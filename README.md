# 3D Closet Designer

A web application built with React and Three.js that allows users to design a 3D closet with customizable dimensions, colors, and number of doors and shelves. The app also provides real-time calculations for door and shelf dimensions, as well as a 3D visualization of the designed closet.

- **Customizable Components**: Adjust the number of doors and shelves.
- **Color Picker**: Select custom colors for the closet structure, doors, and shelves.
- **Real-Time Calculations**: The app calculates and displays door width, door height, shelf width, shelf depth, and shelf spacing in real-time.
- **3D Visualization**: View a 3D model of the closet that updates based on your inputs.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-closet-designer.git
   cd 3d-closet-designer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

- **Adjust Dimensions**: Use the input fields under "Dimensions" to set the width, height, and depth of the closet.
- **Set Number of Components**: Adjust the number of doors and shelves using the respective input fields.
- **Choose Colors**: Use the color pickers to set custom colors for the structure, doors, and shelves.
- **View Results**: The app will automatically calculate and display the dimensions of the doors and shelves. A 3D model of the closet will be displayed and updated in real-time.

## Technologies

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: JavaScript library for 3D graphics in the browser.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript for type-safe code.
- **CSS**: Styling the components.

## Formulas

The following formulas are used to calculate the closet dimensions:

- **Door Width**: 
  ```
  (Width - 2 * Side Thickness) / Number of Doors
  ```
- **Door Height**:
  ```
  Height - 2 * Top/Bottom Thickness
  ```
- **Shelf Width**:
  ```
  Width - 2 * Side Thickness
  ```
- **Shelf Depth**:
  ```
  Depth - Back Panel Thickness
  ```
- **Shelf Spacing**:
  ```
  (Height - 2 * Top/Bottom Thickness) / (Number of Shelves + 1)
  ```
